TIme Series With LSTM
This project applies Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model and forecast time series data. LSTMs are effective in capturing long-term dependencies and temporal patterns, making them ideal for predicting future values based on historical trends. The project demonstrates preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for accurate time series forecasting.
